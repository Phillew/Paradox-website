<div id = "Body">
<p> As the physical part of an human being, the body is constituted of member such as head with its components, feet and so on. </p>
<p> This part gets old as the time goes and becomes <strong style = "color : red"> sometimes, at a certain moment, non operational as the the members get damaged by many circumstances.</strong> </p>

<p> However, if we consider what we know, everything starts with a sperm and the ovulation process. Then, an human being is born with the necessary members and grew up.</p>
